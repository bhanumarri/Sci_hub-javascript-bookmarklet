# Sci-Hub javascript bookmarklet
This javascript completely owe to [@Deleetdk's code](https://github.com/Deleetdk/scihub_doi_bookmarklet/blob/master/code.js). Since the directed sci-hub website provided by the original code is no longer usable. I updated it here. Besides, here I try to make the steps clearer, even if you have zero knowledge about javascript and creation of bookmark on a browser.

# Steps
1. Hover your mouse over the bookmark bar;
2. Right click in blank area of the bookmark bar;
3. Find the option "create webpage (G)" (ps. depend on your navigator, naming could be slightly different);
4. Now you can edit your own bookmarklet on the pop-up window;
5. Name: (let's say) Sci-hub Passkey; Website: copy and paste [the javascript](https://github.com/ygjose/Sci_hub-javascript-bookmarklet/blob/master/Sci-hub%20Passkey.js);
6. Voila! You will be seeing a new bookmark on your bookmark bar. That means you successfully created your sci-hub passkey.

# Now, how to use
Easy peasy! You just need to go to the webpage of that paper (say, an article from Elsevier) that you want to download. And one that very page you can usually find doi. **Now when you click on the newly created bookmarklet, it should be able to automatically identify the DOI and redirect you to PDF download page of Sci-Hub.**
